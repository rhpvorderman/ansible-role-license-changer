Role Variables

```YAML
license_changer_project_dir: "/your/project/"
license_changer_project_file_regexp: "*"              # The regular expression for the filenames that need a license
license_changer_header_file: "/your/project/LICENSE"  # The license header file
license_changer_header_prefix: '# '                   # All the lines in the header will have this prefix
license_changer_header_suffix: ''                     # All the lines in the header will have this suffix
license_changer_check_mode: False                     # In check mode files are not changed. But if licenses are not present
                                                      # then it will exit with 1. Useful for CI purposes
license_changer_header_before: BOF                    # Same as blockinfile before
license_changer_header_after: EOF                     # Same as blockinfile after
license_changer_header_start: "# -----"               # First line of the header.
license_changer_header_end: "# ....."                 # Last line of the header
                                                      # These acts as a boundary. Next time you change the license everything
                                                      # between start and end is changed
